1- Why we use version controling tools like git?
   As a devops engineer we are dealing with codes and for controling them we need to use tools like git.

2- What is a repository? what important files should be in a repository?
  A repository is a place for storing our commits and branches. and a good repository should have 3 differente files which are:
  1: README.md 2: LICENSE 3: .gitignore

3- What are the main parts in a good documentation?
  A good documentation consist of :
  1- what are the goal of this project and what does it do.
  2- how can you use it.
  3- how can you contribute on this project.(optional) 

4- What does "git clone" do?
  if we like someone's project on github and we want to save it on our local system we use this command.

5- How can we synchronize our local-repository with remote-repository?
  git pull/push <remote-repository>

6- What are the differences between checkout,revert,reset?
  we use checkout for move between branches, if we want to cansel our commit to last commit without affecting on our working-tree we use reset but if we
  want to erase all of our changes with commit and working-tree but we want to know the reason and time-line in log, we use revert.

7- What are the difference between merge and rebase?
  the merge operation interwined the branches together by creating a new single merge commit but compare to rebase for example if have two commits in
  feature branch and we want to interwined featue branch with master, the two commits simply got rewind and reapply on top of master featue, keeping
  the history linear.

8- What command is used for viewing the history of commits?
  git log

9- What command is used for viewing the changes on a file?
  git diff HEAD

10- What is the application of "tag"? how can we create tag?
  for make release we use tag. using this command: git tag <version-number>

11- What is the procedure of contributing on a project that managed by git?
  first we have to clone the project using "git clone" command. after that we have project on our system, we start developing. after that we make changes on 
  project it's time to merge with master branch. finally for sinchronizing between local-repo and remote-repo we use "git push/pull" command.

12- What we use branches and how can we merge them?
  it depends on developing style of the team and we can use different branches for developing different part of the codebase and for merging branches together
  we use "git merge/rebase" command
